LiveSplit.Wrack
=====================
Autosplitter and Ingame Time tracker [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) component for [Wrack](http://store.steampowered.com/app/253610/).

Features
--------
* Automatic splitting on level ends.
* Automatic reset when loading the first map of the campain (e1l1.map).
* Tracks ingame time without resetting it when loading a save.

Install
-------
1. Go in LiveSplit's Splits Editor
2. Set the Game Name to "Wrack"
3. Click Activate.

Configure
---------
   You can access the settings by clicking Settings in the splits editor. **To keep your settings after you relaunch LiveSplit you have to save your splits.**

If you want to compare your splits against Game Time:
* Right click on Livesplit's window **->** Compare Against **->** Game Time

#### Alternate Timing Method
   If you want to display both Game Time and Real Time in your layout, I suggest getting the Alternate Timing Method component     from [LiveSplit's website](http://livesplit.org/components/) or from its own [GitHub    page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
